### <a name="chapter1part1"></a>Chapter 1 - Part 1: What is Data Engineering?

Data engineering is the backbone of any data-driven organization. 
It encompasses the design, construction, and management of the infrastructure that allows us to collect, store, process, and analyze data at scale. Without robust data engineering practices, data science and data analytics efforts would be severely limited, as they rely on the availability of clean, reliable, and accessible data. 
This lesson will provide a comprehensive introduction to the field of data engineering, covering its core principles, key concepts, and essential skills.

#### <a name="chapter1part1.1"></a>Chapter 1 - Part 1.1: Core Principles of Data Engineering

Data engineering is guided by several core principles that ensure data systems are reliable, scalable, and maintainable. 
These principles are crucial for building effective data solutions that meet the evolving needs of an organization.

**Reliability**

Reliability refers to the ability of a data system to consistently perform its intended functions without failure. This includes ensuring data is accurate, complete, and available when needed.

**Data Quality**: Maintaining high data quality is paramount. This involves implementing data validation checks, data cleansing processes, and data monitoring systems to identify and correct errors or inconsistencies. For example, a data pipeline that ingests customer data from various sources should include checks to ensure that email addresses are valid, phone numbers are correctly formatted, and duplicate records are identified and removed.

**System Stability**: Data systems should be designed to withstand failures and unexpected events. This can be achieved through redundancy, fault tolerance, and robust error handling mechanisms. For instance, a data warehouse should be configured with backup and recovery procedures to ensure data can be restored in the event of a hardware failure or data corruption.

**Monitoring and Alerting**: Continuous monitoring of data systems is essential for detecting and resolving issues promptly. This involves tracking key metrics such as data latency, data volume, and system performance, and setting up alerts to notify engineers when anomalies are detected. For example, an alert could be triggered if the data ingestion pipeline experiences a sudden drop in data volume, indicating a potential problem with the data source.
